In the fast-paced world of DevOps, technology and automation often dominate the conversation. But what if the true secret to DevOps success lies not just in the tools, but in the people? In this engaging and thought-provoking session, Patrice Williams Lindo, CEO of Career Nomad, will challenge the conventional approach to DevOps by focusing on agile leadership and the human dynamics that fuel innovation, collaboration, and sustainable success.

Drawing from her 17+ years of experience consulting with Fortune 500 companies and leading high-stakes transformations, Patrice will explore how leaders can break down silos, cultivate high-performing teams, and create a resilient culture that thrives in fast-moving DevOps environments. This isn't about quick fixes or patching technical problems. Instead, it's about building a long-term, sustainable strategy that fuses the power of human ingenuity with cutting-edge DevOps practices.

Throughout the session, Patrice will provide real-world examples, case studies, and practical strategies on how to elevate team performance, boost collaboration, and create alignment between technology and human-driven innovation. Attendees will walk away with actionable insights on:

•Agile Leadership in DevOps: How to lead with agility and create a culture of continuous innovation and resilience within your DevOps teams.
